### 2) Modify Rule Set File Manually

* Open ruleset file in text editor.
* Change value of attribute 'Name' (ruleset is represented in the IDE by its name).

### 3) Attach Rule Set to Project(s)

* Open csproj file in text editor or go to Solution Explorer - Project - Context Menu - Edit ProjectName.csproj
* Add following `PropertyGroup` (or add element to the existing `PropertyGroup`):

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <CodeAnalysisRuleSet>RELATIVE_OR_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_RULESET_FILE</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Old csproj format (.NET Framework)

## Directory.Build.props File

It may be convenient to to specify ruleset in **Directory.Build.props** file.
This file is typically located in a root folder of a solution.

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <CodeAnalysisRuleSet>$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)my.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
