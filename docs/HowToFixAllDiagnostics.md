# How to: Fix All Diagnostics in a Solution

1) Download package [Roslynator.CommandLine](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Roslynator.CommandLine/)&ensp;[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Roslynator.CommandLine.svg)](https://nuget.org/packages/Roslynator.CommandLine)

2) Extract package (for example to `C:\\roslynator`)

3) Open Command Line Prompt (cmd.exe)

4) Change directory to directory where **roslynator.exe** is located (for example `C:\\roslynator\\tools\\net461`)

5) Execute following command:

```
roslynator fix SOLUTION
```
## How to Reference Analyzer Assemblies

Roslynator will use analyzers and code fixes that are referenced as NuGet packages.
It will not use analyzers and code fixes that are part of Visual Studio extensions.
If you want to use these assemblies you have to use `--analyzer-assemblies` option. For example:

```
roslynator fix SOLUTION --analyzer-assemblies ANALYZER_ASSEMBLY PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ANALYZER_ASSEMBLIES
```

## How to Use Custom Rule Set

```
roslynator fix SOLUTION -p CodeAnalysisRuleSet=FULL_PATH_TO_RULE_SET
```

It is necessary to specify full path to rule set as each project has different working directory.
